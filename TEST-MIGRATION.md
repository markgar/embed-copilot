# Test Suite Migration - September 30, 2025

## What Was Done

### ✅ Archived Old Tests
- Moved all 28 existing test files to `test-archive-2025-09-30/`
- Old tests are preserved but will NOT run
- Can be deleted anytime or kept for reference

### ✅ Created Fresh Test Structure
```
test/
├── jest.config.js          # Clean, simplified configuration
├── setup.js                # Test environment setup
├── README.md               # Documentation for writing tests
├── unit/                   # Unit tests (individual functions)
│   └── example.test.js
├── integration/            # Integration tests (multiple components)
│   └── example.test.js
└── e2e/                    # End-to-end tests (full user flows)
    └── example.test.js
```

### ✅ Test Results
All 3 example tests passing:
- ✓ Unit test example
- ✓ Integration test example  
- ✓ E2E test example

## Next Steps

### 1. Write Your First Real Test
Start small! Pick one function or endpoint and test it.

**Example - Testing a utility function:**
```javascript
// test/unit/utils.test.js
const { someFunction } = require('../../src-v2/utils');

describe('someFunction', () => {
  it('should return expected value', () => {
    expect(someFunction('input')).toBe('expected');
  });
});
```

### 2. Add Integration Tests
Test your API endpoints:
```javascript
// test/integration/api.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../../src-v2/app');

describe('Health Check API', () => {
  it('should return 200', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/health');
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

### 3. Add E2E Tests (When Ready)
Test full user flows with Puppeteer.

### 4. Remove Example Tests
Once you have real tests, delete:
- `test/unit/example.test.js`
- `test/integration/example.test.js`
- `test/e2e/example.test.js`

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # With coverage report
```

## Benefits of Fresh Start

✅ Clean slate - no legacy baggage  
✅ Modern structure - clear separation of concerns  
✅ Simple config - no complex project setups  
✅ Example tests - learn by example  
✅ Fast - only 3 placeholder tests run in <1 second  

## If You Need to Reference Old Tests

All old tests are in: `test-archive-2025-09-30/`

You can:
- Browse them for ideas
- Copy specific tests if needed
- Delete the archive when you're confident

## Philosophy

**Start small, build incrementally**
- Don't try to test everything at once
- Focus on critical paths first
- Add tests as you build features
- Keep tests simple and readable
