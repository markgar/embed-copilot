# Development Guide

## Running the Project

**The recommended way to run this project is through VS Code tasks.**

### Quick Start
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. The "Dev Server" task automatically starts when you open the folder
3. If it doesn't auto-start: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Dev Server"

### Why VS Code Tasks?
- Automatic startup when folder opens
- Integrated terminal with proper environment variables
- Background process that doesn't block the UI
- Consistent development experience

### Manual Alternative
If needed, you can also run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
