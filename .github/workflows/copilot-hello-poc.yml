@github-copilot Hello! 👋

I need you to review the current **ARCHITECTURE.md** documentation against the actual codebase in this repository to identify any discrepancies or needed updates.

## 📋 **Your Task:**

1. **Read the ARCHITECTURE.md file** in the repository root
2. **Analyze the current codebase structure** (especially the \`src-v2/\` directory)
3. **Compare the documentation against the actual code** 
4. **Identify any gaps, inaccuracies, or needed updates**

## 🎯 **What to look for:**

- **File paths and structure** - Are the documented paths correct?
- **Service/controller methods** - Do the documented methods exist?
- **Dependencies and integrations** - Are external APIs and libraries accurate?
- **Architecture patterns** - Does the actual code match the documented architecture?
- **Missing components** - Are there new files/services not documented?

## 📝 **Expected Output:**

Please create a PR with either:

**Option A:** If changes are needed:
- Update the ARCHITECTURE.md file with corrections
- Document any new components or changes
- Explain what was outdated and how you fixed it

**Option B:** If no changes are needed:
- Create a simple \`ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_${currentTime.replace(/[^0-9]/g, '')}.md\` file
- Document that you reviewed the architecture
- Confirm alignment between docs and code
- Note the review date and any observations

---

**Repository Context:**
- Main backend code: \`src-v2/\` directory
- Frontend code: \`public/js/modules/\` directory  
- Configuration: \`config/\` directory
- This is a Node.js app with PowerBI integration and OpenAI chat

**Goal:** Keep our architecture documentation accurate and up-to-date!`,
